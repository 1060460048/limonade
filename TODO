# TODO #

- solving all opened tickets http://sofadesign.lighthouseapp.com/projects/29612-limonade/overview
- more unit and functional tests
- adding documentation about changes between 0.3 and 0.4
- update README files with new features / changes
- in run(), passing   to all functions that require it
- implements stop_and_exit() call with register_shutdown_function
- params function should be singular like option ?
- adding a debug() helper
- new redirect_to (support for https)
- adding url_rewrite features
- enhance url_for with url rewrite
- add header X-Limonade-PHP: (lim version name); (cosmetic ;-)
- use array_walk_recursive for unregister_globals
- add a LIM_START_MEMORY with memory_get_usage()
- add a simple helper to benchmark (execution time / memory)

- adding HEAD HTTP support (#12 HTTP HEAD request results in a 500 response code)
- add a render_partial function (shortcut for render, without the layout param...)
- adding gzip option (http://fr.php.net/manual/en/zlib.configuration.php#ini.zlib.output-compression)
- simple form helper with XSS/CSRF protection


- remove examples/ and move it in an external depot
- more examples


- public API documentation:
    - tests: tag private functions
    - tests: describe in docblock header abstract definitions
    - add links in header/welcome page(blank.tpl): project web site (clic on logo?), README, github



## Later ##

- create capture helpers `content_for($name) ... end_content_for()`. That will help sending content from views to layout
- add routing support for dispatching to class methods: `dispatch('/hello/:name', 'Hello::who');`
- add routing support for dispatching to lambdas (requires PHP 5.3.0):

â€“

    dispatch('/hello/:name', function(){ 
        // process data here 
    });

- http caching
- file caching
- x-sender headers for serving static files directly thru Apache and Lighttpd


## Think about it ##

- adding an options array to dispatch functions. Perhaps for supporting user agent detection, language detection or something like that ?
- make post, put and delete params accessible with the params() function
    (take care of possible conflict with a route param: by default override get params, but raise an error notice). Really useful ?
