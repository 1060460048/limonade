# TODO #

- about the _method parameter in POST requests: adding example
- designing default limonade views
- adding url_rewrite features
- more examples
- http caching
- file caching
- make post, put and delete params accessible with the params() function
    (take care of possible conflict with a route param: by default override get params, but raise an error notice)
- a session helper
- redirect method
- x-sender headers for serving static files directly thru Apache and Lighttpd

- more unit testing

- public API documentation:
    - tests: tag private functions
    - tests: describe in docblock header abstract definitions
    - add links in header/welcome page(blank.tpl): project web site (clic on logo?), README, github
